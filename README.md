# Event-Trees-Formalization

Event Tree (ET) analysis is widely used as a forward deductive safety analysis technique for decision-making at a system design stage. ET is a schematic diagram representing all possible operating states of components in a system. In these scripts, we propose to use higher-order-logic (HOL) theorem proving for formal modeling and analysis of
ET diagrams. The HOL formalization of ETs is based on a generic list-datatype that can construct an arbitrary level of ET diagrams. We also develop a formal approach in HOL to reduce ET nodes and branches, partition ET paths, and perform the probabilistic analysis based on the
occurrence of certain events. For illustration purposes, we conduct the formal ET analysis of an electrical power grid and also determine its System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), which is an important indicator for system reliability.
