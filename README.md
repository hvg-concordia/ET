# Event-Trees-Formalization

Event  Tree  (ET)  analysis  is  widely  used  as  a  forward  de-ductive safety analysis technique for decision-making at the system design stage. ET is a schematic diagram representing all possible operatingstates of components in a system. In this paper, we propose to use higher-order-logic (HOL) theorem proving for the formal modeling and analysisof ET diagrams. The HOL formalization of ETs is based on agenericlist-datatype that can construct an arbitrary level of ET diagrams. Wealso develop a formal approach in HOL to reduce ET nodes and branches, partition ET paths, and perform the probabilistic analysis based on theoccurrence of certain events. For illustration purposes, we conduct theformal  ET  analysis  of  an  electrical  power  grid  and  also  determine  itsSystem  Average  Interruption  Frequency Index (SAIFI),  which  is  animportant indicator for system reliability.
